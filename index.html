<!-- $Id: f00_New-to-photography.txt,v 1.1 2010-02-17 21:07:59 gustaf Exp $ -->

<p>The best way to learn is to shoot (assuming you either have a digital
camera, or have budgeted for plenty of film). Shooting digital is
essentially free after the downpayment of gear and computer for
viewing and processing, so there's nothing to hinder you from taking
plenty of shots.</p>

<p>Study what works and what doesn't. Pay attention to the values in your
EXIF: shutter speed, aperture, ISO (if you have auto-ISO set). Be
methodical, repeat yourself, and have fun!</p>

<p>Realistically, Canon or Nikon. If you have a bunch of older lenses for
Minolta AF or Pentax, consider getting a modern body to mount them
on. But if you're starting from scratch, the amount of used gear
available for sale for CaNikon is much greater than for the other
brands, maybe excepting Pentax. There's a lot of gear available for
rent as well.</p>

<p>Canon or Nikon? Get the body that suits your hands. If you know
someone who has either system and is willing to lend you lenses and
accessories, this can be a tipping point.</p>

<p>You might also want to try <a href="http://snapsort.com/">Snapsort</a> which summarizes a lot of information about cameras to help reach a decision.</p>

<h3><a name="What-lenses-should-I-buy-first">What lenses should I buy first for my DSLR?</a></h3>

<p>If you're buying a DSLR for the first time, and you're not a seasoned
photographer, you should probably opt for an entry-level model. There
are a few reasons for this. First, even an entry-level camera can take
absolutely stunning images. Second, if you're new to DSLR photography
you're going to be concentrating on learning the basics instead of
learning a complex new camera. Third, cameras lose value just as fast
as other consumer electronics, so it makes sense to start out with a
lesser outlay until you can justify it by either making money with
your pictures or discovering that your shooting needs something that
your current camera can't deliver.</p>

<p>Most new cameras are sold in a kit with a "kit lens", usually a normal
zoom (i.e. one that spans the range between ~28mm and ~70mm) of
moderate slowness (typical average aperture is &#x0192;/4). These lenses are
a compromise of cost and quality -- they're inexpensive and
decent. Manufacturers realise that most consumers will only get one
lens and it should be good enough for them.</p>

<p>If you want to move outside this area your options for a good general
purpose lens are limited. The classic 50mm that used to be included in
camera kits before zooms got good enough is regularly extolled in
blogs and forums as the "nifty fifty". And sure, it's sharp, and
fast. Problem is, on crop you'll get a field of view around 70mm, far
too long for general photography. By all means, get it if you have the
money, but make sure you have something that can covers a more useful
range too.</p>

<p>Nikon has recently introduced the 35mm &#x0192;/1.8 DX that can serve as a
fast normal for crop lenses. Canon has a (full-frame) 28mm &#x0192;/1.8
that's an ideal normal on their 1.6x crop bodies, but you're paying a
premium for an image circle that covers more than you need. Sigma has
a 30mm &#x0192;/1.4 which is nice but rather big and heavy.</p>

<p>My take is buy the kit, take decent care of it until you find out what
you want to shoot. Do you mostly go wide? Consider getting a
wide-angle zoom. Haunting the long end? A 70-200 might be the thing
for you. In either case, the kit can be used for travel or parties or
walkaround in good light. Just sell it if you need a little cash.</p>

<h3><a name="Full-frame-vs-crop">Full frame vs. crop DSLRs</a></h3>

<p>If you're in the market for a high-end DSLR, you might want to get a
full-frame (Canon 5D mk III,  Nikon D800, D4, Sony
A900) vs. a crop "prosumer" body (Canon 7D, Nikon D7000, Sony
A77). What to chose?</p>

<p>Full frame advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>wides are wides again, plenty of older primes for fields-of-view below 28mm</li>
<li>less depth-of-field (debatable if this is an advantage, but people like it)</li>
<li>better high-ISO performance</li>
</ul>

<p>Crop advantages</p>

<ul>
<li>teles are "longer"</li>
<li>lighter bodies (only applies to bodies without integral grips)</li>
<li>cheaper by a significant margin</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#head">^up</a></p>

<h3><a name="What-compact-camera-should-I-buy">What compact camera should I buy?</a></h3>

<p>(For the purposes of this article, a "compact" is defined as a digital
camera with a non-removable lens and a sensor smaller than the
smallest DSLR sensor, which is the 4/3 at time of writing).</p>

<p>Compact cameras have one primary advantage over DSLRs, and that's the fact that they're smaller.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there are mostly negative factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>the sensors are small, and there are too many pixels crammed into them. This makes for lousy high-ISO performance</li>
<li>the tiny sensor means that lenses have very short focal lengths, which gives a huge depth-of-field. This can be a positive in some cases, but is often decried in this age of bokeh worship</li>
<li>the AF is often slow, leading to horrendous shutter lag</li>
<li>viewfinders, when they even exist, are small and nearly useless. This leads to having to use the rear LCD, which doesn't help camera stability</li>
<li>there's very little scope of helping the camera's low-light capabilities out with the help of an external flash</li>
</ul>

<p>If I were getting a compact, I'd get one with a small size, image
stabilisation, decent wide-angle (28mm field-of-view is the bare
minimum), weather resistant, and that shares memory cards format with
my DSLR. Stuff like flash hotshoe is a plus, but if it leads to larger
size, forget it.</p>

<p>The main point with a compact is a camera you can carry everywhere,
for party shots, landscapes and portraits in good light, and a digital
diary. For most people, a phone camera will cover the latter.</p>

<p>Forget about "bridge cameras" (these have DSLR-like styling and size,
but have a compact-camera sensor and EVF). You can get better pics
picking up a low-end DSLR and a decent zoom lens.</p>

<p>Premium compacts such as the Canon G10 and the Panasonic LX3 have
their uses, but they cost as much as a low-end DSLR too.</p>

<p><a href="http://snapsort.com/">Snapsort</a> is a site for deciding what camera to buy and has a large section devoted to compact cameras.</p>

<h3><a name="Protective-filters">Should you buy a "protective" filter for your lens?</a></h3>

<!-- $Id: f09_Protective-filters.txt,v 1.2 2009-11-20 19:30:12 gustaf Exp $ -->

<p>Protective filters are clear-glass or UV filters that are meant to
protect the front of your lens (the objective) from harm.</p>

<p>In general, you don't need a filter. As explained in <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/columns/sm-feb-05.shtml">Mike Johnston's
article</a>,
modern objectives are tough and durable. A sturdy lens hood will keep
it away from harmful scratches and improve your images to boot. A
cheap filter, on the other hand, can degrade image quality. A broken
filter can also be a serious problem, see <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/nz/klaus-and-stefan">Philip Greenspun's story
here</a>.</p>

<p>However, if you're shooting in places with blowing sand or rain, a
filter can indeed fulfil the protective role. Keep in mind, though,
that good filters are expensive, and should perhaps only be considered
when you're shooting in the aforementioned conditions, or you have an
expensive lens with a bulbous front element.</p>

<h3><a name="Depth-of-field">Does sensor size affect depth of field?</a></h3>

<!-- $Id: f08_Depth-of-field.txt,v 1.3 2009-09-06 18:58:17 gustaf Exp $ --> 

<p>Theoretically, no, but practically yes. </p>

<p>First, "depth of field" is an approximation. It's simply the volume
adjacent to the plane of focus where the circle of confusion is small
enough to appear sharp at some combination of print size and viewing
distance. The circle of confusion is in its turn dependent on the
imaging area's makeup and size.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/equations.html">equations for calculating depth of
field</a> use focal length,
aperture, and circle of confusion. Imaging surface size has no impact
(except on CoC, as mentioned above). Its apparent affect on the DoF is
simply due to the fact that different focal lengths are needed for
each imaging surface size to maintain the same field of view.</p>

<p>Here's a practical example. Say you want to shoot a subject from 3
metres away. You have 3 bodies, a crop DSLR (APS-C sensor), a film
body (or "full-frame" DSLR), and a 6x6 MF body. The normal lenses for
these bodies are 28mm, 45mm, and 80mm respectively.</p>

<p>This table shows the depth of field for two apertures, &#x0192;/2.8 and &#x0192;/8:</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<caption>Depth of field (in metres) at 3m focusing distance</caption>
<tr align="center">
<th>Lens</th> <th>Circle of confusion (mm)</th> <th>&#x0192;/2.8</th> <th>&#x0192;/8</th> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td>28mm</td> <td>0.02 (digital sensor)</td><td align="right">1.34</td> <td align="right">5.75</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>45mm</td> <td>0.033 (135 film)</td> <td align="right">0.83</td> <td align="right">2.75</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<p>For basic editing and cataloguing,
<a href="http://picasa.google.com/linux/">Picasa</a> is a good choice.</p>

<p>For advanced photo editing and retouching (think Photoshop), there is
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the GIMP</a>. Although available for Mac OS X and
Windows these days, it was originally developed for Linux, SGI IRIX
and HP-UX, so it works quite well. It can do a lot of what Photoshop
can do, though if you are a veteran Photoshop user, it's likely that
the interface will drive you insane.</p>

<p>There are also fundamental technical limitations inherent in the GIMP;
see this <a href="http://troy-sobotka.blogspot.com/2011/01/why-gimp-is-inadequate.html">damning
article</a></p>

<p>There is a project called <a href="http://www.gimpshop.com/">gimp-shop</a> that
attempts to wrap a Photoshop-like layer around the GIMP.</p>

<p>For RAW processing/workflow software (think Aperture, Lightroom, etc),
there is <a href="http://bibblelabs.com/">Bibble</a> It contains support for most
modern RAW image formats you'd expect, and is designed to operate on
them in bulk. A free-as-in-freedom alternative is
<a href="http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/">UFRaw</a>.</p>

<p>Another alternative is <a href="http://darktable.sf.net">Darktable</a> which is under active development.</p>
